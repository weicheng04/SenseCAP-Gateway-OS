# SenseCAP Gateway OS

SenseCAP Gateway OS is a multi-protocol IoT gateway operating system designed for industrial indoor scenarios. It is based on OpenWrt and provides a standardized software foundation, covering three key capabilities: LoRaWAN gateway, industrial bus data acquisition, and building compliance reporting.

The system adopts an innovative lightweight architecture combining a Debian host with a single LXC container (OpenWrt). All business logic is encapsulated and runs within a single OpenWrt container, while the host system is responsible only for hardware abstraction and container management. This design achieves optimal resource utilization, strong security isolation, and operational flexibility.

## Features

- **Minimal Host System**: The Debian host retains only the kernel, LXC toolchain, hardware drivers, and UPS monitoring, without running any application-level services.
- **Single-Container Architecture**: All services (LoRaWAN services, networking, peripheral management, and web services) run within a single LXC container as native OpenWrt packages.
- **Simplified Operations**: The single-container design simplifies configuration management, upgrade rollback, and troubleshooting, reducing operational complexity.

> **Note:** The diagram above only illustrates the software components running inside the LXC container (OpenWrt). The host system (Debian) layer — including the Linux kernel, hardware drivers, LXC runtime, UPS monitor, and user data storage — is shown separately at the top and is not part of the container image.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **OS**: Ubuntu/Debian Linux
- **Disk Space**: > 50GB recommended
- **Memory**: > 8GB recommended

### Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential clang flex bison g++ gawk \
  gcc-multilib g++-multilib gettext git libncurses5-dev \
  libssl-dev rsync unzip zlib1g-dev file wget
```

### Build Steps

#### 1. Initialize Submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 2. Clone OpenWrt Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git -b openwrt-24.10
cd openwrt
rm -r feeds.conf.default
cp ../feeds.conf.default feeds.conf.default
```

#### 3. Update and Install Feeds

```bash
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
```

#### 4. Apply Configuration

```bash
cp ../.config .config
make defconfig
```

#### 5. (Optional) Disable Rust LLVM CI Download for Faster Build

```bash
sed -i 's/--set=llvm.download-ci-llvm=true/--set=llvm.download-ci-llvm=false/' \
  feeds/packages/lang/rust/Makefile
```

#### 6. Build

```bash
unset CI GITHUB_ACTIONS CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION
make -j$(nproc)
```

#### 7. Get Build Output

After completion, the firmware is located at:

```
openwrt/bin/targets/armsr/armv8/openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-rootfs.tar.gz
```

### Customization

To customize the firmware (e.g., add packages, modify kernel settings), run menuconfig in the openwrt directory:

```bash
cd openwrt
make menuconfig
```

## Deployment

The firmware is deployed to the device via LXC container:

### 1. Stop Existing Container

```bash
sudo lxc-stop -n SenseCAP
```

### 2. Clean and Create New rootfs

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lxc/SenseCAP/rootfs
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lxc/SenseCAP/rootfs
```

### 3. Extract New Firmware

```bash
sudo tar -xzf /path/to/openwrt-armsr-armv8-generic-rootfs.tar.gz \
  -C /var/lib/lxc/SenseCAP/rootfs
```

### 4. Start Container

```bash
sudo lxc-start -n SenseCAP
```

### 5. SSH to LXC Container

```bash
sudo lxc-attach -n SenseCAP
```

### 6. View Logs

```bash
# LoRa packet forwarder logs
logread | grep lora

# System logs
logread
```

### 7. Web Interface

Access `http://[IP_ADDRESS]/cgi-bin/luci` for:

- **Status Overview**: LoRa status, network connections, packet statistics
- **Services**: LoRa, network and other configurations

## Function Modules

### LoRaWAN Gateway

- **Config File**: `/etc/config/lora_pkt_fwd`
- **Service**: `lorawan_gateway`
- **UI**: LuCI Gateway app

![LoRaWAN Architecture](docs/images/lorawan_architecture.png)

### ChirpStack Concentrator

- **Target**: `seeed-gateway`
- **Service**: `chirpstack-concentratord`

### LTE/WWAN Support

- **Config**: `/etc/config/network`
- **Firewall**: LTE and WWAN networks have firewall rules added

### Multi-WAN Support

Supports multiple WAN configurations including LTE and Ethernet, with load balancing and failover capabilities.

#### Network Interface Architecture

The reComputer R1225 is equipped with **two physical Ethernet ports** (ETH0 and ETH1). These two ports serve different roles based on the host-container architecture:

| Port | Role | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **ETH0** | Container (LXC) interface | This interface is **directly mapped (passthrough) from the hardware into the LXC container** via the host's LXC network configuration. The OpenWrt container has full control over this interface, managing it as a standard WAN or LAN port. All application-level traffic (LoRaWAN uplink, MQTT, Web UI access, etc.) flows through this port. |
| **ETH1** | Host (Debian) interface | This interface is **managed by the Debian host system**. It is used for host-level management tasks such as SSH access to the host, container management operations, firmware updates, and UPS monitoring communication. It remains isolated from the container network stack. |

This separation ensures that even if the container network is misconfigured or unreachable, the host management interface remains accessible for recovery and maintenance.

### RS485 / Modbus

- **Config Files**: `/etc/config/rs485-module` (serial, mqtt, protocol)
- **Services**: `rs485-module`, `rs485-modbus`
- **UI**: LuCI RS485 app (Serial Settings, Protocol Settings, MQTT Settings, MQTT Log)

The RS485 module supports industrial protocols including **Modbus RTU** and **BACnet MS/TP**:

- **Modbus RTU**: Polling and parsing of Modbus registers via the RS485 serial interface, with data forwarded through MQTT uplink/downlink.
- **BACnet MS/TP**: BACnet protocol support over RS485 for building automation integration (Web configuration in progress).

## FAQ

### Build Fails

**Problem**: Errors during compilation

**Solution**:
- Check disk space (recommend > 50GB)
- Ensure submodules are updated: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Rust compilation is slow, disable CI LLVM download to speed up

### Cannot Access After Deployment

**Problem**: Cannot access web interface after container starts

**Solution**:
- Check LXC container status: `sudo lxc-ls -f`
- View container logs: `sudo lxc-info -n SenseCAP`
- Verify network configuration is correct

### LoRa Data Not Displaying

**Problem**: No data on LoRa status page

**Solution**:
- Check concentrator service status
- View logs: `logread | grep -i lora`
- Verify gateway configuration is correct
